# Fake News Detection with a Bi-directional LSTM in Keras

This repository performs the following operations:
1. Importing fake and real news datasets with Pandas and checking sizes and null values
2. Exploring the imported dataset and feature engineering
3. Performing data cleaning
4. Visualizing the cleaned dataset
5. Preparing the dataset for training by performing tokenization and padding
6. Build and train a bidirectional LSTM model
7. Evaluating the model performance
